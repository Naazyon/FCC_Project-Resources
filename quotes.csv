A lot of people say I'd miss show business if I quit. I'd miss some of it. Now it's the only life I know.	Loretta Lynn
'Ludacris' is something that I made up. It just kind of describes me. Sometimes I have like a split personality. Sometimes I'm cool, calm, and collected, and other times I'm beyond crazy.	Ludacris
The Internet is a powerful way to make lots of money... But we are not going to buy Yahoo!	Sumner Redstone

Art is the unceasing effort to compete with the beauty of flowers - and never succeeding.	Gian Carlo Menotti
Some people call it global warming some people call it climate change. What is the difference?	Frank Luntz
The world is a crazy, beautiful, ugly complicated place, and it keeps moving on from crisis to strangeness to beauty to weirdness to tragedy. The caravan keeps moving on, and the job of the longform writer or filmmaker or radio broadcaster is to stop - is to pause - and when the caravan goes away, that's when this stuff comes.	David Remnick
After I lost my fiance, it seemed like it would be better to always be alone than to risk being hurt again.	Nancy Grace
Hungary is, in a word, in a state of WAR against the Hapsburg dynasty, a war of legitimate defence, by which alone it can ever regain independence and freedom.	Lajos Kossuth
I dated a guy and he liked me but I didn't like him. I went through his wardrobe and cleaned out his house and got him to get a new car. He said to me, 'If I give you $10,000, will you find me my wife because I want someone like you?' And within a year, he got married. That was the first match that led to me leaving my corporate job.	Patti Stanger
Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees the others.	Aristotle
The attitude is we live and let live. This is actually an amazing change in values in a rather short time and it's an example of freedom from religion.	Tom Wolfe
Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter.	Jane Austen
Palin was a political Hail Mary, a long bomb in the closing minutes of a game that John McCain and Co. were certain to lose. They didn't care if she had the policy or political or emotional capacity to serve as vice president, let alone president. They were willing to drive the country off a cliff, if that's what it took to win.	Dee Dee Myers
I was very sexual from a very young age.	Portia de Rossi
There is one other business where the customer is always wrong and that's the media.	Rush Limbaugh

Rather like Batman, I embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family, courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong, good and bad and justice.	Gary Oldman
On the stage, you alone hold the key, and on the night you have to trust that the director has inspired you enough to take the material and run with it.	Greta Scacchi
I also believe that government has no business telling us how we should live our lives. I think our lifestyle choices should be left up to us. What we do in our private lives is none of the government's business. That position rules out the Republican Party for me.	Jesse Ventura
I alone of English writers have consciously set myself to make music out of what I may call the sound of sense.	Robert Frost

The art of love is largely the art of persistence.	Albert Ellis
As a young man, even if I was going to see a play or a film by myself, I didn't feel like I was alone. There was something that was unfolding up there that brought me into it. And I recognised that. For those two hours, it made me feel like I belonged to something really good.	Tom Hanks
Elizabeth Taylor. In her heyday, she was amazing.	Joe Jonas
Science and vision are not opposites or even at odds. They need each other. I sometimes hear other startup folks say something along the lines of: 'If entrepreneurship was a science, then anyone could do it.' I'd like to point out that even science is a science, and still very few people can do it, let alone do it well.	Eric Ries
My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.	Jerry Saltz
Profits in business always depend on the rate of interest: the higher the interest, the higher the rate of profit required.	James Buchan

An artist must be a reactionary. He has to stand out against the tenor of the age and not go flopping along.	Andre Maurois
I really, specifically, love acting, and I think it's a really cool thing to be really indulgent and follow that. I have a lot of ambitions in life, but for the next few years, I just want to be an actor. That's a lucky opportunity, and that drives me to want to be good at that.	Kristen Stewart
My parents armed me with an amazing sense of humor, and it's what you need when, well, it's what anyone needs in this world.	Warwick Davis
I understand and get when kids and teenagers feel like they're alone and it's not going to get better. My advice is that there is a support system out there, there are a lot of people who have been through what you're going through and are going through it now.	Brittany Snow
I didn't appreciate the young woman that I was, or my young beauty, because I was so obsessed with the fact that I felt fat. It's never good to add to anybody else's suffering. It's an important topic to really get the gravity and the importance of - dealing with dignity.	Margaret Cho
That we find a crystal or a poppy beautiful means that we are less alone, that we are more deeply inserted into existence than the course of a single life would lead us to believe.	John Berger
I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland. And when we moved to America, it was just the typical thing except I was really good at it so was my brother.	Eddie Van Halen
Men of age object too much, consult too long, adventure too little, repent too soon, and seldom drive business home to the full period, but content themselves with a mediocrity of success.	Dale Carnegie
To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car. The only reason I wanted to make money as an actor was because I'm passionate about food!	Hugh Jackman
The advice of the elders to young men is very apt to be as unreal as a list of the hundred best books.	Oliver Wendell Holmes

All the freaky people make the beauty of the world.	Michael Franti
Art is the objectification of feeling.	Herman Melville
When you create art, the world has to wait.	Will Smith
Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.	Jerry Saltz
I miss Saturday morning, rolling out of bed, not shaving, getting into my car with my girls, driving to the supermarket, squeezing the fruit, getting my car washed, taking walks.	Barack Obama
Going to church doesn't make you any more a Christian than going to the garage makes you a car.	Laurence J. Peter
My personal view is that such total planning by the state is an absolute good and not simply a relative good... I do not myself think of the attitude I take as deriving from Marx - though this undoubtedly will be suggested - but from Fichte and Hegel.	John Grierson
Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you'll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).	Jerry Saltz
We are so bound together that no man can labor for himself alone. Each blow he strikes in his own behalf helps to mold the universe.	Jerome K. Jerome

I was entirely natural and in many ways I have the same attitude now. I don't mourn the loss of my youth because I believe you should enjoy what you have while you have it.	Koo Stark
Beauty is worse than wine, it intoxicates both the holder and beholder.	Aldous Huxley
The divine right of husbands, like the divine right of kings, may, it is hoped, in this enlightened age, be contested without danger.	Mary Wollstonecraft

Movies are an expensive business.	Albert Brooks
Never go to bed mad. Stay up and fight.	Phyllis Diller
They keep the old business. We keep the ongoing business.	Harvey Weinstein
When I launched the development of the GNU system, I explicitly said the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers and have freedom, thus if you use some other free system instead but you have freedom, then it's a success. It's not popularity for our code but it's success for our goal.	Richard Stallman
Those people in New York are not gonna change me none.	Elvis Presley
I think that from the time you start playing sports as a child you see that your responsibility to your team is to play the best that you can play as an individual... and yet, not take anything away from being part of a team.	Wayne Gretzky
When that shutter clicks, anything else that can be done afterward is not worth consideration.	Edward Steichen
Advertising is the art of convincing people to spend money they don't have for something they don't need.	Will Rogers
I have a wonderful husband. I have three amazing kids.	Celine Dion
I think failure is nothing more than life's way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome, but in not trying. It is liberating. Most people attach failure to something not working out or how people perceive you. This way, it is about answering to yourself.	Sara Blakely
I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school. Like all red-blooded teen American boys, I'd come home from water polo practice and eat a box of Entenmann's Pop'Ems donut holes in front of the TV while obsessively fawning over 'All My Children' and Erica, her clothes, and her narcissistic attitude.	Andy Cohen
He travels fastest who travels alone, and that goes double for she. Real feminism is spinsterhood.	Florence King
Like any business, the oil industry runs on the basic premise of supply and demand. The more supply - the lower the price. The higher the demand - the higher price. In other words, the more people who can buy oil, the higher the price of oil.	Ron Wyden
The man who goes alone can start today but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready.	Henry David Thoreau
'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.	Jerry Saltz
Literature is the art of discovering something extraordinary about ordinary people, and saying with ordinary words something extraordinary.	Boris Pasternak
To me, photography is an art of observation. It's about finding something interesting in an ordinary place... I've found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.	Elliott Erwitt
The novelist teaches the reader to comprehend the world as a question. There is wisdom and tolerance in that attitude. In a world built on sacrosanct certainties the novel is dead.	Milan Kundera

So little done, so much to do.	Cecil Rhodes
